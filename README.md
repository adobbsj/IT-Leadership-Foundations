INTRODUCTION
It is important for you as an IT professional to communicate with colleagues and navigate workplace situations. Being able to understand the different behavioral styles of individual team members and develop strategic thinking skills will help you choose appropriate communication techniques and influence tactics to effectively work with them. It will also help you evaluate situations from different points of view and recommend effective strategies for decision-making. 



For this task, you will use the scenario, the attached “Implementation Email,” and the “Implementation Meeting” video found in the Web Links section to analyze interpersonal dynamics, evaluate communication strategies, and develop a plan to lead a follow-up meeting.

SCENARIO
You were recently hired as the implementation team lead for Seamus Company. After completing your orientation and onboarding period, you are assigned as the point of contact on a company-wide equipment upgrade project that has been delayed once already. Your supervisor, Kamal, who also serves as the committee chair of the project, is looking to you to get this project launched quickly and effectively. While there are over a dozen teams on your list to upgrade, you have proposed an initial, single-team rollout in order to pilot your implementation plan and resolve any unforeseen issues in that plan. You asked Kamal to select the best team for your pilot rollout. Kamal identified two potential teams and scheduled a meeting with the team managers and a data analyst to decide which team should be prioritized for the equipment upgrades. This is a critical decision that your team is waiting on in order to start planning. Unfortunately, you were unable to attend the meeting due to a last-minute conflict.

Since you are new to the organization, you have not yet built relationships with any of the people who attended the meeting. Kamal recorded the meeting and shared it, along with the meeting minutes, via email. You also see that Diego, the manager of Team A, requested time to meet with you one-on-one. While the project is behind schedule and you have only been assigned to this role for one week, you cannot move forward with planning until you know which team to prioritize in the rollout. Following the events of the initial meeting, you are tasked with analyzing the meeting and developing a meeting agenda for a follow-up meeting to facilitate agreement on prioritizing one of the two teams.
